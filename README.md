FaceMarkr is a Python-based face recognition system for automated attendance tracking. Using OpenCV, face_recognition, and NumPy, it captures video from an external camera and matches faces with a customizable database of known images. The system allows users to define their own image databases, making it flexible for different use cases. It automatically marks attendance and can store records in either a MySQL database or as a CSV file, with a new sheet generated for each day.
